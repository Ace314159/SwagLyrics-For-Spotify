SwagLyrics for Spotify
======================

SwagLyrics fetches the currently playing song from Spotify and displays the lyrics in the command-line or in a browser tab. Refreshes automatically when song changes. The lyrics are fetched from Genius. Spotify Desktop currently does not provide lyrics natively, which SwagLyrics does beautifully if I may say so myself.


User's Guide
