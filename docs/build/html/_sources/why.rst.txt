Why Swaglyrics?
===============

SwagLyrics is the fastest and the most accurate package for getting lyrics.1

Provided optimal internet, SwagLyrics can fetch lyrics for a track in as less as 0.28s.2

It also does not require the user to generate any sort of API token (Spotify or Genius) and serves functionality right off the bat. This is possible as the song identification is done using our in-house library SwSpotify which does it locally for all operating systems.

The enhanced user experience is possible due to the backend which manages creating issues for unsupported songs and then adding support for them where possible by employing various techniques. Any song with lyrics on Genius can be supported without any user interaction owing to the backend. If say, lyrics do not exist for a track then subsequent playings of that track will not waste your resources in trying to fetch lyrics, this is done by a master list of unsupported songs which is handled by the backend as well.
